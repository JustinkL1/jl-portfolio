          Hi, I'm Justin Lam!
        </span>
        <br />
        I'm from the Bay Area and graduated with a degree in Computer Science
        from Purdue University. Recently, I completed my master's at Johns
        Hopkins University, where I specialized in Enterprise and Web Computing.
        I'm passionate about growing my software development skills and working
        on meaningful projects. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, cooking, and
        traveling.
